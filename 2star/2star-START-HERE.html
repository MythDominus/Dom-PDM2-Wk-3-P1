            <p>One advantage of moving some code, particularly classes, into separate files is 
                that it makes the code easily reusable across sketches. Your task is create 
                a standalone class representing a creature or character (you may recycle your PDM 1 character), 
                then develop two different animated sketches that use the same creature. Here are 
                the steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a new JavaScript file. It will contain your creature class so name it appropriately.</li>
                <li>Add a &lt;script&gt; tag to this HTML file to connect your new file.</li>
                <li>Put the p5.js <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> functions as well as any global 
                variables you need in sketch.js and write your creature class in the file created in step 1. Try 
        to design your class to be as multi-purpose as possible!</li>
                <li>Do something creative but not too taxing with your creature in sketch.js e.g. make it move with the mouse.</li>
                <li>Create another JavaScript file. This will be your second sketch so name it something appropriate e.g. 
                    sketch2.js.
                </li>
                <li>Link your new sketch file and your creature file in the other HTML file (2star-secondSketch.html) in this sketch folder.</li>
                <li>Finally, do something different with your creature in your second sketch e.g. make an army of creatures. If your class 
                    is well designed, you should be able to run both sketches at the same time and see different behaviour in each.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>There is an example of a pair of sketches that both use the same character in the <a href="https://github.com/UoY-IM-PDM2-2324/PDM2-example-code/tree/main/Practical%20solutions/W3P1/2star" target="_blank">example code repo</a>. 
                The videos below show the output of each sketch. In the first sketch, the penguin walks back and forth and honks when the user presses "h". In 
                the second sketch, one penguin is controlled by the user ("a", "d", and "j" keys) and the others appear when as eggs hatch. The same <code>Penguin</code> class 
                is used to draw and move all penguins in both sketches.

                    <p>The file created in step 1 should contain only the creature class. Do not put any code 
                        specific to one sketch in the file, otherwise your are likely to have side effects in your 
                        other sketch. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you get error messages stating that something is undefined, see if you need to swap the order in 
                        which the JavaScript files are linked in the HTML.
